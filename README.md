The log module is a Zend Framework module that provides support for Monolog logger channels. This module also comes
with a standard error logger enabled which is used to log PHP notices, warnings and errors in applications.

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require polderknowledge/log-module
```

Next add the module to the module config (usually `config/modules.php` or `config/application.config.php`):

```php
return [
    'modules' => [
        'PolderKnowledge\\LogModule',
    ],
];
```

Last but not least, copy over the dist configuration files located the `config/` directory to
your application's autoload directory.


## Usage

This module has a predefined `ErrorLogger` logging channel configured. This channel is used to write PHP notices, 
warnings and errors to. Since it depends on the application on how to handle these messages, there are no handlers 
defined for this channel.

## Change log
